Add new key to get paid for models:  in chat window, drop down the model dropdown and pick 'select premier models' or whatever it says.  It will let you pick the company (anthropic, openai, etc) and a pop up window will ask for the API/secret key from that company. you would generate that key at that company site.  Then just paste the key in the popup window that asks for it and then the new models will be available in the dropdown.
